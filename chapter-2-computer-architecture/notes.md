* P.O Boxes are lockable mailboxes located in a post office station. Each box is a unit of storage that is fixed in size. Computers also have their own versions of P.O boxes - we call it memory.
* A number doesn't mean anything to a computer. It could be a value that's an ASCII code or an address to a memory location. Or maybe it's just gibberish. A computer just knows what to do with that number and that number will not have any meaning to to us until something is done with it. If it's used to look up a value, then to us that number was an address.
